<h1>Silhouettes</h1>

<h2><u>Input:</u></h2>
<p>The input comming in on the BufferedReader consists of an even number of <i>
silhouettes </i>with a blank line marking the end of each silhouette.&nbsp; Each 
problem consists of a pair of silhouettes.&nbsp; As usual, you must supply your 
answer to a problem before continuing on to the next problem, so your code <u>
<b>must stop</b></u> after reading the second blank line which marks the end of 
the second silhouette and thus the end of a problem.&nbsp; After answering the 
problem, your code should continue reading again to get the next problem.</p>
<p>Each silhouette consists of a sequence of integers, one per line followed by 
a blank line.&nbsp; As described in class, the numbers indicate alternating x 
and y coordinates.&nbsp; Please download the following PDF document 
that gives a sample problem and answer with corresponding figures:

http://marrerosrv.cstcis.cti.depaul.edu:8080/csc421/silhouette.pdf</a></p>
<h2><u>Output:</u></h2>
<p>As discussed in class, your output in reply to reading in a pair of 
silhouettes is the single silhouette that would result from combining/&quot;merging&quot; 
the two silhouettes.&nbsp; Your output should be in the same format as the 
input, namely one integer per line with a blank line marking the end of your 
answer.&nbsp; Again, please refer to <a href="http://marrerosrv.cstcis.cti.depaul.edu:8080/csc421/silhouette.pdf">
http://marrerosrv.cstcis.cti.depaul.edu:8080/csc421/silhouette.pdf</a> 
for an example.</p>
<h2><u>End of Input:</u></h2>
<p>The end of all input will be marked by an additional blank line.&nbsp; Once this 
extra blank line is reached on the input, you may return control to the caller 
of your run function.</p>
<h2><u>Example:</u></h2>
<p>The input for two silhouettes might look like:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New">9<br>
5<br>
12<br>
7<br>
15<br>
0<br>
<br>
3<br>
4<br>
4<br>
0<br>
14<br>
9<br>
17<br>
0<br>
</font><br>
<br>
The output would would then look like:<br>
<br>
<font face="Courier New">3<br>
4<br>
4<br>
0<br>
9<br>
5<br>
12<br>
7<br>
14<br>
9<br>
17<br>
0</font><br>
<br>

figures illustrating this example.</p>
<h2><u>Hint:</u></h2>
<p>The logic to do this correctly for all cases can be subtle.&nbsp; You might 
want to consider implementing the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Construct a loop that scans the two input silhouettes left to right 
	(analogous to merge for merge sort)</li>
	<li>Always look for the &quot;next x&quot; at which one (or both) of the silhouettes 
	changes</li>
	<li>At that X value, you will need to know what the Y values are for the two 
	input silhouettes.&nbsp; The larger Y value will be the Y values in the 
	answer</li>
	<li>CAREFUL!!!, that does not mean you automatically output that X,Y to your 
	answer.&nbsp; If the correct Y value is the same as the last Y value that 
	was placed into the answer, you should not output anything.&nbsp; In 
	particular consider the two following input silhouettes:<ul>
		<li>10, 5, 20, 0</li>
		<li>20, 5, 30, 0</li>
	</ul>
	The answer is:&nbsp; 10, 5, 30, 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and NOT&nbsp; 10, 5, 
	20, 5, 30, 0</li>
</ul>
